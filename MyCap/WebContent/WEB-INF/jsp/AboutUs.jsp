<h2>Allan Sattelberg-Rivera</h2>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>As a 4th year student at Ohio State University enrolled in the university's
 Computer Science and Engineering Program, I've completed coursework in both the practical
 and purely mathematical aspects of object oriented programming.  In addition to these conceptual skills,
 I have also worked on full stack webapplication development, relational database design and implementation,
 operating system.  I am currently involved in courses that deal with software project management and distributed
 computing using IBM Websphere.
 </p>
<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>]I am familiar with CSS and HTM through my other coursework, and as such I attempt to take the initiative with these responsiblities.
I do not shy away from material that I am unfamiliar with though, and complete a fair portion of backend work as well.
